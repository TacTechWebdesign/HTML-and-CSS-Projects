            <h3>Pizza Fritta</h3><img src="./Images/Thumb/thumbnail_1.png" alt="thumbnail_1">
            <div>
              <p>A classic Neapolitan street food, pizza fritta is fried pizza dough. It comes in many different shapes and forms. For example, montanara is round while calzone is shaped like a half moon. Like many other great things in life, pizza fritta was born out of a crisis. After World War II, the price of mozzarella and wood for the ovens increased dramatically. In order to continue to serve their staple dish, cooks in Napoli decided to fry the dough instead of baking it, filling it with ingredients they had on hand instead.</p>

            <h3>Pizza alla Pala</h3><img src="./images/thumb/thumbnail_2.png" alt="thumbnail_2">
            <div>
              <p>Meaning "paddle pizza" in Italian, pizza alla pala originated in Roman bakeries as a way to use up leftover bread dough. Bakers would stretch the dough lengthwise, top it with fresh ingredients, and serve it by the slice on a wooden paddle. Unlike pizza Napoletana, this style has a highly-hydrated dough (about 80% water) and is cooked in an electric oven around 580°F. The dough is denser and rises for a long time, giving each slice a soft, fluffy interior and a crispy exterior. Get a slice at your local Eataly and try our recipe!</p>

            <h3>Pizza Napoletana</h3><img src="./images/thumb/thumbnail_3.png" alt="thumbnail_3">
            <div>
              <p>Born in Napoli, la pizza Napoletana is one of the most famous types of Italian pizza. Protected by a Traditional Specialty Guaranteed (TSG) certification, this style must be made in a very particular way. The dough is comprised of wheat flour, yeast, salt, and water and is left to rise for up to 24 hours. It's shaped by hand into a flat, round disk, about 3 millimeters thick. After that, it's topped with ingredients and baked for 90 seconds in a blisteringly hot (around 900°F) wood-burning oven. The result is a soft, elastic heart with a tall, fluffy crust called the cornicione in Italian. You can find this variety at your local Eataly's La Pizza & La Pasta restaurant.</p>

            <div>
              <p>Pizza alla pala isn't the only variety of pizza from Italy's capital city. In Roman pizzerie, you'll find another type: la pizza tonda Romana. This kind is flat and round and it has a very thin crust. Unlike pizza Napoletana, this style is crispy and has an almost cracker-like crust!</p>
