                    <p>A classic Neapolitan street food, pizza fritta is fried pizza dough. It comes in many different shapes and forms. For example, montanara is round while calzone is shaped like a half moon. 
                        Like many other great things in life, pizza fritta was born out of a crisis. After World War II, the price of mozzarella and wood for the ovens increased dramatically. 
                        In order to continue to serve their staple dish, cooks in Napoli decided to fry the dough instead of baking it, filling it with ingredients they had on hand instead.</p>
